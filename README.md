## 1.1 The Basics
1. UX Designer
2. A UX Designer, also known as a "User Experience Designer," plays a crucial role in developing digital products that offer an enjoyable UI experience for users on the web and apps.
They conduct extensive research to gain an in-depth understanding of user requirements and preferences and utilize this information to create detailed wireframes, prototypes, and user flow diagrams.
Working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers and product managers, UX designers ensure that the final product meets both business objectives and user needs. They keep up-to-date with the latest technology and design trends; continuously refining their skills and techniques to enhance their work.
3. While there are no strict education requirements to become a UX designer, a degree in a computer-related program can enhance your chances of success. However, many professionals in this field find success without a bachelor's degree, with their exceptional hard and soft skills.
4. Technical skill requirements include an overall understanding of graphic design on the web via tools such as: 
Figma 
Adobe XD
HTML 
CSS
Java 
Javascript
PHP & Python

There are many technical skills required, however it all depends on the wireframe in which the UX designer needs to perform changes on. For example, if you were working for Meta, which uses python for most of its overall application, then you would likely stick to this language only. 

As for soft skills, UX designers are expected to have good communication as teamwork is very frequent and with that, they also need to have the ability to collaborate with those working on the same project. Finally they are expected to have great research skills in order to properly start, continue, or finish a project.
