## 1.1 The Basics
### UX Designer
#### *Description*
A UX Designer, also known as a "**User Experience Designer**," plays a crucial role in developing digital products that offer an enjoyable UI experience for users on the web and apps.

They conduct extensive research to gain an in-depth understanding of user requirements and preferences and utilize this information to create detailed wireframes, prototypes, and user flow diagrams.

Working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers and product managers, UX designers ensure that the final product meets both business objectives and user needs. They keep up-to-date with the latest technology and design trends; continuously refining their skills and techniques to enhance their work.

#### *Education*
While there are **no strict education requirements** to become a UX designer, a degree in a computer-related program can enhance your chances of success. However, many professionals in this field find success without a bachelor's degree, with their exceptional hard and soft skills.

#### *Technical and Non-Technical Skills*
**Technical skill** requirements include an overall understanding of graphic design on the web via tools such as: 
- Figma 
- Adobe XD
- HTML 
- CSS
- Java 
- Javascript
- PHP & Python

These are some of the many **technical skills** required, however it all depends on the wireframe in which the UX designer needs to perform changes on. For example, if you were working for Meta, which uses python for most of its overall application, then you would likely stick to this language only. 

As for **soft skills** or **non-technical skills**, UX designers are expected to have good communication as teamwork is very frequent and with that, they also need to have the ability to collaborate with those working on the same project. Finally they are expected to have great research skills in order to properly start, continue, or finish a project. 

#### *Career Salary Range*
The expected salary range of a UX designer located in the US is: 

| Salary Range | Expected Salary  (in USD)|
|--------------|-----------------|
| Low          | $85k            |
| Mid          | $121k           |
| High         | $174k           |

The expected salary range of a UX designer located in Canada is: 

| Salary Range | Expected Salary (in CAD)|
|--------------|-----------------|
| Low          | $55k            |
| Mid          | $81k            |
| High         | $118k           |


## University Education for UX Designers

Most people who enter the UX field do not usually sign up for a UX-only program. Instead, they may have discovered their interest in UX after studying to be a program developer and thus transitioned to this career field. Therefore, the chosen institution and area of learning is meant to act as a stepping stone in your career. Thus, most computer-related courses will be a viable choice as you attempt to enter this field.

Here are some examples of courses and programs related to UX design:

### University of Toronto (UofT) for Computer Science

The following courses are offered at UofT for computer science:

- CSCA08 - Introduction to Computer Science
- CSCA20 - Introduction to Programming
- CSC165H1: Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science
- CSC240H1: Enriched Introduction to the Theory of Computation
- CSC110Y1: Foundations of Computer Science I
- CSC111H1: Foundations of Computer Science II
- MAT137Y1: Calculus with Proofs
- MAT157Y1: Analysis I
- MAT135H1: Calculus I
- MAT136H1: Calculus II

These are some of the courses that you can take in your first year of UofT's computer science program. Some of these courses may be omitted if the candidate has a strong background in the content (programming language) that is being learned. 

To graduate with a degree in computer science at UofT, you must complete a minimum of 20.0 credits, comprising your program requirements, electives and breadth requirements, as well as a minimum CGPA.

### Ontario Secondary School Diploma

To gain acceptance to a UX program, you will likely need to have an Ontario Secondary School Diploma with six 4U/M courses, including Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) and English (ENG4U). A supplemental application may also be required.

### PhD in UX Design

To complete a PhD in UX design, you will typically need four years of education, or five years if entering directly from a bachelorâ€™s program.
