## 1.1 The Basics: UX Designer
### *Description*
A UX Designer, also known as a "**User Experience Designer**," plays a crucial role in developing digital products that offer an enjoyable UI experience for users on the web and apps.

They conduct extensive research to gain an in-depth understanding of user requirements and preferences and utilize this information to create detailed wireframes, prototypes, and user flow diagrams.

Working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers and product managers, UX designers ensure that the final product meets both business objectives and user needs. They keep up-to-date with the latest technology and design trends; continuously refining their skills and techniques to enhance their work.

### *Education*
While there are **no strict education requirements** to become a UX designer, a degree in a computer-related program can enhance your chances of success. However, many professionals in this field find success without a bachelor's degree, with their exceptional hard and soft skills.

### *Technical and Non-Technical Skills*
**Technical skill** requirements include an overall understanding of graphic design on the web via tools such as: 
- Figma 
- Adobe XD
- HTML 
- CSS
- Java 
- Javascript
- PHP & Python

These are some of the many **technical skills** required, however it all depends on the wireframe in which the UX designer needs to perform changes on. For example, if you were working for Meta, which uses python for most of its overall application, then you would likely stick to this language only. 

As for **soft skills** or **non-technical skills**, UX designers are expected to have good communication as teamwork is very frequent and with that, they also need to have the ability to collaborate with those working on the same project. Finally they are expected to have great research skills in order to properly start, continue, or finish a project. 

### *Career Salary Range*
The expected salary range of a UX designer located in the US is: 

| Salary Range | Expected Salary  (in USD)|
|--------------|-----------------|
| Low          | $85k            |
| Mid          | $121k           |
| High         | $174k           |


The expected salary range of a UX designer located in Canada is: 

| Salary Range | Expected Salary (in CAD)|
|--------------|-----------------|
| Low          | $55k            |

## 1.2 Standard Education at UofT

Many individuals who pursue a career in UX design typically do not enroll in a specialized UX-only program from the outset. Instead, they often develop an interest in UX after studying to become a program developer, and subsequently make the transition to the UX field. As such, the educational institution and area of learning chosen can serve as a crucial stepping stone in one's career path. Thus, **most computer-related courses** are generally considered viable options for those seeking to enter the UX field.

Here is an overview for a computer science program at **University of Toronto**.

### *Computer Science Entrance Requirements*

To gain acceptance to a UX program, you will likely need to have an Ontario Secondary School Diploma with **six 4U/M courses**, including Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) and English (ENG4U). A supplemental application may also be required.


The following courses are offered duiring the first year of computer science:

- [CSC148H1](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc148h1) Introduction to Computer Science

### *Degree Completion*
These are some of the courses that you can take in your first year of UofT's computer science program. Some of these courses may be omitted if the candidate has a strong background in the content (programming language) that is being learned. 

To graduate with a degree in computer science at UofT, you must complete a minimum of **20.0 credits**, comprising your program requirements, electives and breadth requirements, as well as a **minimum CGPA**.


### *PhD in UX Design*

To complete a PhD in UX design, you will typically need four years of education, or five years if entering directly from a bachelor’s program.

<br/><br/>
## 1.3 Experiential Learning

UX Design is a field that provides a great deal of flexibility in terms of learning opportunities. With the abundance of online resources available, it is possible to learn the basics of UX design without enrolling in a traditional educational program. One approach is to take advantage of the many online courses offered by platforms like Udemy or Coursera. Alternatively, you can opt for online bootcamps, which offer structured learning experiences that include video lectures, assignments, and quizzes to reinforce and solidify key concepts.

Furthermore, the internet is home to a plethora of free resources such as blogs, articles, and forums where you can learn from other designers and industry experts. You can also browse dedicated YouTube channels that focus on UX design and watch tutorials and case studies to hone your skills.

In addition to gaining technical skills through self-teaching, you can also enhance the non-technical aspects of UX design through learning. Many new tasks require you to think creatively, which is one of the most essential skills a designer can possess.
